# Nathan's Nifty Swifty Personal Style Guide

When managing data, writing code, developing software, or generally keeping any kind of published
anything organized, you need to have consistent practices and standards. No, they don't have to be
"best practices". Forcing people to conform to PERFECTLY CONSISTENT writing standards 100% of the
time is a good way to ensure that your workers are unhappy and your unrealistic standards are not
met. Instead, find a balance of the following factors:

1. How much self-discipline you can maintain. This is a moving target. As you practice some
   standards, they will often become rote and no longer require self-discipline. However, if you
   won't use the standards, they aren't worth anything.
2. How much value you gain from the standards. If you DESPISE using the standards and it cuts your
   efficiency in half no matter how much you yell at yourself, and the gain of value doesn't equal
   more than the value of the lost time in lost efficiency, it wasn't worth it. This can be hard to
   gauge because the gained value of organization/standards is difficult to gauge and sometimes not
   apparent. Do you best.
3. Who has to use and maintain these standards? Consider who is using the standards, who is gaining
   value from the standards, and what works best for them.
4. Don't you dare prematurely optimize. Develop standards for things that:
     - Happen more than a few times
     - Need to be communicated
     - Need to be versioned
     - Need to be effective and edited over long periods of time.

Remember, consistency is key. If Nathan is working on a collaborative project and they have
standards, use those standards! Ditto for contributing to existing code/work. Additionally, this is
a living document. Don't make changes lightly, but don't be afraid to improve things. Don't be
paralyzed by making past work out of date with respect to this document. The goal is to get better
at this. Try not to change styles inside a project, but if you must, it's okay. Definitely do not
change styles inside a single document. These standards are meant to be used anywhere where Nathan
is the sole user or where he gets to dictate the style rules for the project.

### 1. Code <a name="code"></a>

As a general rule, default to Google Style Guides. If there are edits/exceptions, they will be noted
here.

#### C <a name="ccode"></a>

#### Java <a name="java"></a>

Use the [Google Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html).

#### Python <a name="python"></a>

Use the [Google Python Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html). It is also
worth reading the native Python Style Guide, [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).

#### Python - Jupyter Notebooks <a name="ipynb"></a>

In Progress

#### R <a name="rcode"></a>

Use the [Google R Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.html). However, the Google
R Style Guide is a fork of Hadley Wickham's [Tidyverse Style Guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/)
and only notes their disagreements.
